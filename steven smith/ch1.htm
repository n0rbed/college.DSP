Digital Signal Processing is one of the most powerful technologies that will shape science
and  engineering in the twenty-first century.  Revolutionary changes have already been
made in a broad range of fields:  communications, medical imaging, radar & sonar, high
fidelity music reproduction, and oil prospecting, to name just a few.   Each of these areas
has developed a deep DSP technology, with its own algorithms, mathematics, and
specialized techniques.  This combination of breath and depth makes it impossible for
any one individual to master all of the DSP technology that has been developed.  DSP
education involves two tasks:  learning general concepts that apply to the field as a
whole, and learning specialized techniques for your particular area of interest.  This
chapter starts our journey into the world of Digital Signal Processing by describing the
dramatic effect that DSP has made in several diverse fields.  The revolution has
begun.
